---------------- First Prompt to build the app skeleton ----------------------

I would like you to build a fully functional react webapp that has 3 screens.

Shared screenshot has the 3 screens in the order. Please use it to build the look and feel of the app.

Following are the functional requirements of the app:
 - Screen1 is for first time visit. When a user visits first time, we should get their name in the textbox and store in local storage and not show this screen during subsequent visits and take the user directly to screen 2. We should also get the user's location and store in local storage
 - Every time a user visits the website, if their name and location are present in local storage, make an API call to http://localhost:4000/todaysNews with userName and location as parameters. Response will contain a list of news items each containing a text headline, brief text summary of the news and an audio news objects as stream. Refer to screen 2 and build a music player like interface with first news item playing automatically and the next set of news one after another. User should be able to skip to previous and next news items. 
 - User should be able to swipe left to get to screen 3, where the text version of the news is shown. On swiping up, next news item should be shown. When user is in screen 3, they should be able to swipe right to get back to screen 2 where the current news continue to play automatically from where it was left.

 Can you implement this fully with right structure and relevant files for seperation of concerns following react's conventions.
